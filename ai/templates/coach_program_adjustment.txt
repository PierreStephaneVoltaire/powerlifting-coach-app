# Adjustment Request
{{adjustment_reason}}

# Instructions
Analyze the user's current program and recent performance, then suggest appropriate adjustments.

Consider:
1. **Volume Management**: Are they recovering adequately? Signs of overreaching?
2. **Intensity**: Are RPE trends appropriate for their competition timeline?
3. **Movement Selection**: Are accessories addressing weak points?
4. **Periodization**: Are they progressing appropriately through their training block?
5. **Competition Prep**: If within 4 weeks of comp, prioritize specificity and recovery

# Response Format
Provide your analysis and recommendations in the following structure:

## Analysis
Brief assessment of current situation (2-3 sentences)

## Recommended Adjustments
- **Squat**: [specific changes to volume/intensity/exercise selection]
- **Bench**: [specific changes to volume/intensity/exercise selection]
- **Deadlift**: [specific changes to volume/intensity/exercise selection]
- **Accessories**: [specific changes if needed]

## Rationale
Explain why these adjustments will help (2-3 sentences)

## Next Steps
What the athlete should focus on in the coming week

# Guidelines
- Be conservative with volume increases (max 10% per week)
- Respect the competition timeline - don't add high-fatigue work close to comp
- If performance is declining, consider deload or reduced volume
- Maintain movement specificity as competition approaches
- Always explain your reasoning clearly
